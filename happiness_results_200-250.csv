 Input: x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24 = 0","

Output: x = 2, x = 3, x = 4

Explanation:

The given equation is a cubic equation, and it can be factored as:

x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24 = (x - 2)(x^2 - 2x + 6) = 0

Therefore, the solutions are x = 2, x = 3, and x = 4.

Note: In this example, we have used the fact that any polynomial of degree 3 or higher can be factored into linear factors, which is not always the case.","

 Output: x = 6, x = 4, x = 3, x = 2

 Example:

 x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24 = 3x^2 + 6x + 12 = 0

 x = 6, x = 4, x = 3, x = 2

 x = 6 * 2 + 4 * 3 + 3 * 1 + 2 * 1 = 12 + 12 + 9 + 6 = 30

 Congratulations! You have successfully solved the equation x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24 = 0.

The solutions are:

 x = 6
 x = 4
 x = 3
 x = 2

You have found the values of x that make the equation true. Great job!

 Input: ""If x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.""","

Output: True

Explanation:

If x is a positive integer, then x>0.

If x is a solution to x+3>4, then x>4.

Therefore, if x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.

So, the statement is true.

Note: In this problem, we are given that x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4. We need to prove that if x satisfies one of these conditions, then x satisfies the other condition.","

Output: ""Proven! The statement is true.""

Steps:

1. If x is a positive integer, then x>0 and x>12.
2. If x is a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.
3. If x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.

Proven! The statement is true.

Step 1:
If x is a positive integer, then x>0 and x>12.

Step 2:
If x is a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.

Step 3:
If x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.

Proven! The statement is true.

This proof shows that the statement is true by demonstrating that if x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12. The proof uses logical reasoning and evidence from the statement to prove its validity. The",POSITIVE,0.948283851146698,POSITIVE,0.997416615486145
17,"Based on the facts that have been provided, prove the following statement.
 Input: Statement: ""For every integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 ≥ 0""
Fact: The square of any real number is non-negative.","

Output: The statement is true for all integers k.

Explanation:

Since the square of any real number is non-negative, the square of an integer k is also non-negative. Therefore, k^2 ≥ 0.

Adding 2k to both sides of the inequality, we get:

k^2 + 2k + 1 ≥ 0

Since the left-hand side of the inequality is a sum of two positive numbers, the inequality is true.

Therefore, the statement ""For every integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 ≥ 0"" is true for all integers k.","
 Proof: Let t be a real number. Then, t^2 = t * t = t * t * t = 3t * t.
 So, t^2 is non-negative and t * t * t = 3t * t is greater than t * t.
 Therefore, t^2 + 2t + 1 = 3t * t + 2t + 1 is greater than t * t * t = 3t * t.
Now, let k be an integer. Then, k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k * k) + 2k + 1 = 3k * k + 2k + 1 = 3k * (k * t) + 2k + 1.
So, k^2 + 2k + 1 is greater than 3k * t + 2k + 1, which is greater than t * t * t = 3t * t.
Therefore, for every integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 ≥ 0.

Explanation:

The statement is true because if j and k are odd, then j and k are both odd numbers, and the product of two odd numbers is always odd.

Therefore, the correct answer is True.","

Output: Yes, absolutely true!

Explanation:

For all integers j and k, if j and k are odd, then j and k are both 1 and 1 multiplied by 1 is 1. So, jk is 1 and 1 multiplied by 1 is 1.

This statement is absolutely true!

 Input: 5, 14, 23, 32, 41, ...","

Output: n(n+1)/2

Explanation:

The given sequence is a sequence of consecutive even numbers.

The nth term of the sequence can be computed as:

n(n+1)/2

where n is the nth term of the sequence.

For example, to compute the first 5 terms of the sequence, we have:

5(5+1)/2 = 14
14(14+1)/2 = 23
23(23+1)/2 = 32
32(32+1)/2 = 41
41(41+1)/2 = 50

Therefore, the first 5 terms of the sequence are 14, 23, 32, 41, and 50.

Note: The formula n(n+1)/2 is known as the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.","

 Input: A study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.","

 Output: The study found that exposure to dim light at night can have negative effects on sleep and increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes.

 Input: Data entry clerk in United States","
 Output: $25,000 to $35,000 per year

Explanation:

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median annual salary for data entry clerks in the United States was $32,320 in May 2020. However, salaries can vary depending on factors such as location, experience, and industry.

Assuming a 40-hour workweek and 52 weeks per year, the hourly wage for a data entry clerk would be:

$32,320 / 2,080 hours (40 hours/week x 52 weeks/year) = $15.63/hour

Based on this hourly wage, the estimated annual salary for a data entry clerk in the United States would be:

$15.63/hour x 40 hours/week x 52 weeks/year = $25,632 per year (rounded to $25,000)
