The game's violence is described as \"frenetic hand-to-hand combat\" and includes \"large blood-splatter effects and dismemberment\". Additionally, players can perform finishing attacks that depict close-up impalement and repeated axe strikes to a creature's neck result in decapitation. The game's language is considered \"mild\" because it only includes a few instances of words like \"f**k\" and \"sh*t\". Overall, the game's content is considered appropriate for players aged 10 and older.  "
