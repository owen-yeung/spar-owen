2,"You will be asked to answer the following question as part of the LinkedIn Skill assessments.
 Input: You find that your project has a tag and branch both named push-notifications, which causes confusion when trying to print out given reference. How can you specify which branch you want to look at?","

Solution:

You can specify which branch you want to look at by using the --set-branch option followed by the name of the branch you want to look at. For example, if you want to look at the push-notifications/feature branch, you can use the following command:

git branch --set-branch push-notifications/feature

This will set the current branch to the push-notifications/feature branch, allowing you to print out the reference for that specific branch.

Note: You can also use the --set-branch option without the name of the branch, and Git will prompt you to enter the name of the branch you want to set. For example:

git branch --set-branch

This will prompt you to enter the name of the branch you want to set as the current branch.","

 A. Using the command ""git pull origin push-notifications"" to pull the latest from origin and push-notitions
 B. Using the command ""git push-notifications origin"" to push the latest from push-notifications to origin
 C. Using the command ""git branch --set-upstream-name push-notifications origin"" to set upstream name of push-notifications to origin
 D. Using the command ""git merge origin/push-notifications"" to merge the latest from origin/push-notifications

Answer: C. Using the command ""git branch --set-upstream-name push-notifications origin"" to set upstream name of push-notifications to origin.

Explanation:

You can use the command ""git branch --set-upstream-name push-notifications origin"" to set the upstream name of push-notifications to origin, which means that the push-notifications branch will be referred to as origin/push-notifications. This will allow you to pull the latest from origin and push-notifications by using the command ""git pull origin push-notifications"" or ""git push origin push-notifications"".
