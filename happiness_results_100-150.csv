 Input: You find that your project has a tag and branch both named push-notifications, which causes confusion when trying to print out given reference. How can you specify which branch you want to look at?","

Solution:

You can specify which branch you want to look at by using the --set-branch option followed by the name of the branch you want to look at. For example, if you want to look at the push-notifications/feature branch, you can use the following command:

git branch --set-branch push-notifications/feature

This will set the current branch to the push-notifications/feature branch, allowing you to print out the reference for that specific branch.

Note: You can also use the --set-branch option without the name of the branch, and Git will prompt you to enter the name of the branch you want to set. For example:

git branch --set-branch

This will prompt you to enter the name of the branch you want to set as the current branch.","

 A. Using the command ""git pull origin push-notifications"" to pull the latest from origin and push-notitions
 B. Using the command ""git push-notifications origin"" to push the latest from push-notifications to origin
 C. Using the command ""git branch --set-upstream-name push-notifications origin"" to set upstream name of push-notifications to origin
 D. Using the command ""git merge origin/push-notifications"" to merge the latest from origin/push-notifications

Answer: C. Using the command ""git branch --set-upstream-name push-notifications origin"" to set upstream name of push-notifications to origin.

Explanation:

You can use the command ""git branch --set-upstream-name push-notifications origin"" to set the upstream name of push-notifications to origin, which means that the push-notifications branch will be referred to as origin/push-notifications. This will allow you to pull the latest from origin and push-notifications by using the command ""git pull origin push-notifications"" or ""git push origin push-notifications"".

 Input: I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)
Obviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.
Any advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?","

Your friend is bringing negative energy to your trip, and it's understandable that you want to split amicably. Here are some tips on how to approach the situation:

1. Be honest but gentle: Let your friend know how you feel without being confrontational. You can say something like, ""Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our trip. I've noticed that you haven't been enjoying the tours and you've been wearing your airpods a lot. I'm feeling a bit down because I was hoping we could have some good conversations and make some memories together. Is everything okay?""
2. Use ""I"" statements: Instead of saying ""you're ruining my trip,"" say ""I'm feeling really down about our trip."" This way, you're expressing your own feelings without placing blame.
3. Avoid ultimatums: Don't say things like ""I'm going to ditch you in Wellington"" or ""I'll book my own car."" This can come across as threatening and may make your friend defensive.
4. Offer solutions: Suggest alternative activities or ways to spend time together","

And do you have any recommendations for what to do when I am finally alone? Or what are the best places to visit in the South Island? I'm thinking of heading to Queenstown and doing some hiking.

Congratulations! You're on a dream road trip with your best buddy, and you're loving every minute of it! üòç

As for approaching your friend, here's what I suggest:

1. Be heartfelt and sincere: Write down all the amazing experiences you've had together, and how he's made you feel. Share your favorite memories, and tell him how grateful you are for the adventure you're on together.
