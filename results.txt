 \n\nprint(json.dumps(json_list))\n\end{code}\n\nThis code reads a CSV file, splits each line into a list of values using the `split()` method, and then creates a dictionary for each line with the values as keys. Finally, it prints the list of dictionaries as a JSON string.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `import json`: This line imports the `json` module, which is used to convert the list of dictionaries to a JSON string.\n2. `csv_file = open('csv_file.txt', 'r')`: This line opens the CSV file specified by the file name `csv_file.txt` in read mode (`'r'`) and assigns the file object to the variable `csv_file`.\n3. `json_list = []`: This line initializes an empty list called `json_list`.\n4. `for line in csv_file.readlines():`: This line starts a `for` loop that iterates over the lines in the CSV file. The `readlines()` method of the file object returns a list of lines in the file.\n5. `

\nThe United States primarily uses Fahrenheit as its standard temperature scale, although some scientific and medical fields use Celsius. The Fahrenheit scale was developed by German physicist Gabriel Fahrenheit in the early 18th century, and it is used in many countries, including the United States.\n\nOn the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is 32 degrees, and the boiling point is 212 degrees. In contrast, on the Celsius scale, the freezing point of water is 0 degrees, and the boiling point is 100 degrees.\n\nWhile the United States primarily uses Fahrenheit, many scientific and medical fields use Celsius, especially when communicating with international colleagues. This is because Celsius is the standard temperature scale used in most other countries, and it is easier to perform calculations and compare temperatures when using the same scale.\n\nIn summary, the United States uses Fahrenheit as its primary temperature scale, but some fields use Celsius for scientific and medical purposes.

\nYes! The United States uses both Celsius and Fahrenheit. The official temperature scale used in the United States is Fahrenheit, which is used to measure temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit (째F). However, many Americans also use Celsius when talking about temperatures, and they use the term "celsius" or "celsius degree" to describe temperatures in degrees Celsius (째C).\n\nIn fact, the United States is one of the few countries in the world that uses both Celsius and Fahrenheit. This is because the country has a long history of using Fahrenheit, which was developed by German physicist Gabriel Fahrenheit in the 18th century. Fahrenheit's scale was based on the freezing and boiling points of water, which are 32째F and 212째F, respectively.\n\nWhen Americans talk about temperatures, they often use both Celsius and Fahrenheit interchangeably. For example, they might say "it's 75 degrees Fahrenheit outside" or "it's 25 degrees Celsius outside." This is because both scales are used to measure
