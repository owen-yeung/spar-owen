 Input: Paper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

1,"Answer the question about the paper after reading it carefully.
 Input: To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes.
Question: What is English constituency parsing?","

Answer: English constituency parsing is a task in natural language processing that involves identifying the grammatical structure of a sentence and categorizing its components into constituents. It is a challenging task because the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input.","

Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

6,"Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.
 Input: Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.","

 Input: This is an action-adventure game in which players help Kratos and his son on a dangerous quest. Players explore various realms and engage in frenetic hand-to-hand combat against human-like raiders and fantastical creatures (e.g., centaurs, trolls, dragons). Players use axes and chained blades to battle enemies, often resulting in large blood-splatter effects and dismemberment.

Explanation: The CSS code ""rgba(255, 100, 150, 0.8)"" would produce the light red color with a medium light shade of pink, with a hint of orange.

Thank you!

Answer: You're close! You just need to use the `AND` operator instead of `OR`. Here's the correct formula:

=IF(AND(C7=""U.S.A."", C7=""Canada"", C7=""Europe"", C7=""The Americas""), ""North America"", ""South America"", ""Europe"", ""The Americas"")

How would you write this formula?

Hint: You can use the IF function to check if the value in C7 is equal to one of the given options, and then use the WHEN function to return a different result depending on the outcome.

=IF(C7 IN (""U.S.A."", ""Canada"", ""Europe"", ""The Americas"", ""Asia""), ""Wow, you've been everywhere!"", ""You've never left the country? How boring!"")

This formula uses the IN function to check if the value in C7 is in the list of options, and if it is, then returns the ""Wow, you've been everywhere!"" message. If it's not in the list, then it returns the ""You've never left the country? How boring!"" message.
